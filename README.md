Boston crime data analysis project 2015-2017 

The analysis will focus time and type of crime, and for this reason 
missing data about location will be removed, provided that 
the removed data represents less than 10% of the total dataset. 
Some questions will be asked and answered by graphs in the "analysis" part. 

Furthermore, the data will be uploaded to database and system for interacting 
with it will be created. The system will enable async CRUD operations on the data within 
database. 

When this project is finished, next one will be created: 
REST API based on patterns found and created in this project. 


Data for this project comes from kaggle, provided by Analyze Boston:
