Boston crime data analysis project 2016-2022. 

The analysis will focus time and type of crime, and for this reason 
missing data about location will be removed, provided that 
the removed data represents less than 10% of the total dataset. 
The data will be visualized using graphs. 

Furthermore, the data will be uploaded to database and system for interacting 
with it will be created. The system will enable CRUD operations on the data within 
database. 

The last step will be creation of REST API based on this data.
